\begin{abstract}

A proposed benefit of software fault isolation (SFI)~\cite{Wahbe:1993}
is that it can improve the performance of applications made up of
multiple isolated components communicating via remote procedure calls
(RPC). There is now a mature and widely used SFI implementation for the
x86-64 architecture (Google's Native Client, or NaCl), designed for
hosting untrusted code inside a web browser environment. In this paper,
we address the question of whether SFI can provide a performance
improvement over process-based isolation for modern Linux systems,
without compromising reliability or security. We design and implement an
SFI system based on Native Client with the specific goal of accelerating
ensembles of process that communicate via UNIX pipes, such as those
commonly found in shell scripts, and consider what architectural changes
in the last twenty years (most notably the widespread adoption of 64-bit
address spaces) make an SFI-based approach practical. In our
experiments, we demonstrate that our \emph{Intra-Process Pipe (IPP)}
system gives speedups of up to XXX\% on a collection of shell scripts
found in a standard Ubuntu 16.04 distribution, and speedups of up to
XXX\% on pipelines found in the authors' own shell histories,
making it attractive for speeding up UNIX shell scripts and day-to-day
usage.
